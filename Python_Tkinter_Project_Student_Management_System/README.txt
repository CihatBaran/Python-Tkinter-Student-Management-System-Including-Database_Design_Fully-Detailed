Project is Designed for Student Management System


1-Modules that was used in the main file which is server.py are;
	-tkinter
	-mysql.connector
	-ttk,messagebox from tkinter
	-database (which I created to connect database)
	-cv (Sql queries to create database)

2-Main program folder is Project_Documents

	- cv.py file is Sql code to create database and necessary tables
	- database.py file is to connect database and fetch data from there.
	- server.py is the main file that program executes to login and make transactions.
	- randomData.txt is all data that are randomly added to tables, after the creation of database.


3- Database_Design file has database codes and excel file, that I created random data by using excel.
	
4- Image folder has only one image that I used for login page.

5- You should connect the MySQL Database, before you try to run program;

	- If you type your connection information correct in the first page, 
	program will create a database and add random data to it.
	
	
6- First step is to connect database by inserting database information of your computer that was set by you.
   if you enter correct, code blocks will try to validate if you can connect or not, if you cannot
   connect, it will give error. In conclusion, I first validate database connectivity to not verify
   more in the future steps. Once, it connects in the first step, it will always connect.

   Second Step is to connect as Admin, Professor or Student. 
   NOT- You can use username_password.txt file to try different user.

   Third Step is to try every button's functionality, and different users ability to manipulate datas in the system.
